# Elasticsearch and Kibana Exercise Project (Bahasa Indonesia)


## Project Description
This project is an exercise to analyze the technology industry data using Elasticsearch and Kibana. The workflow of this project consists of fetching data from Google BigQuery, analysis using Python scripts, and sending the analyzed data to Elasticsearch. The ultimate goal of this project is to present the data analysis results through visualizations created using Kibana.

## Workflow
- Data Retrieval: Data is fetched from Google BigQuery. The data retrieved contains information about the technology industry, such as platform usage trends, storage technology trends, programming language usage trends, and more.
- Data Analysis: The retrieved data is then analyzed using Python scripts. Some questions to be answered in this analysis include industry trends, growth in specific technologies, and user behavior patterns.
- Data Sent to Elasticsearch: The results of the data analysis are sent to Elasticsearch for storage and indexing.
- Visualization with Kibana: The data stored in Elasticsearch is visualized using Kibana. This includes creating dashboards, charts, and interactive reports that provide insights into industry trends in the technology sector.


## Questions to be Answered
In this exercise project, there are several questions to be answered:

1. Explain what is meant by NoSQL using your understanding!
2. Explain when to use NoSQL and Relational Database Management System!
3. Mention 2 examples of NoSQL tools/platforms other than ElasticSearch along with the advantages of those tools/platforms!

## Data Used
The data used in this project is related to the technology industry. This data includes various information about platform usage trends, storage technology trends, programming language usage trends, and more. The data is used for simulation in the analysis provided to an investor planning to invest in the technology sector.

## Objective
The objective of this exercise project is to provide experience in analyzing technology industry data using Elasticsearch and Kibana. The analysis results will be used to provide insights to an investor planning to invest in the technology sector.
